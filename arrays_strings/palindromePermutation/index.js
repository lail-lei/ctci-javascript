/**
 * Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check 
 * if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. 
 * 
 * A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
 * A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
 * The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
